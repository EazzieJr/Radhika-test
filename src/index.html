                        Within just 30 minutes of birth, a fawn is already finding its footing. By their second day,
                        they can walk gracefully
                        enough to follow their mother through dense brush.

                        This "bouncy" jumping is sometimes called stotting or pronking. It’s a signal to predators that
                        the fawn is healthy and
                        energetic—basically saying, "Don't bother chasing me, I'm too fast!"

                        Deer are surprisingly excellent swimmers. Their hair is hollow, which acts like a built-in life
                        jacket by providing

                        When a fawn sits, it is often practicing "bedding down." They are coached by their mothers to
                        stay perfectly still to
                        avoid the gaze of passing predators.

                        Fawns are "precocial" animals, meaning they are born in an advanced state. Standing up quickly
                        is a survival evolution
                        to ensure they don't remain vulnerable on the forest floor for too long.

                        Even at a young age, fawns can reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. They often run in a
                        zigzag pattern to confuse
                        anything chasing them.

                        For the first few weeks of life, fawns have virtually no body scent. By lying still in tall
                        grass, they become
                        "invisible" to the noses of wolves and coyotes.

                        While they prefer to hide, a cornered fawn will use its front hooves to strike. This "flailing"
                        motion is surprisingly
                        sharp and serves as a last-resort defense mechanism.

                        directions without even moving their heads.
